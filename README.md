1a. A class is a template for an object, and an object is an instance of a class. From the above scenario, a manager could be a class, where a manager has a name and a salary. An instance of that class would be adding a manager, with his/her name and his/her salary.  
  
1b. The managers and sales personnel are office staff, so those two classes can extend the office staff class. Another example could be a product class. Different types of products can then inherit the product class.  
  
1c. Libraries reduce the work needed significantly by being able to use predefined classes and their methods without having to construct those classes and methods manually.  
  
2b. Accessor methods are needed because the variables are private and shouldn't be changed freely.

2cii. The sales object has accessor methods, but no mutator methods. If something needs to be changed in the future, it can't be changed.

2h. The classes need to have an attribute to keeo track of the data. There should also be a method to calculate the salary by summing up all the sales in a month and then applying the appropriate calculations to get the salary.  
  
2i. Polymorphism can be seen when overloading is used in the SalesPerson class for the two constructors.
